        <h3>Lab: Let’s get started</h3>
        Read this document in its entirety before beginning your lab.<br>
        
        <h3>Problem Domain</h3>
        Create a webpage that accepts user input and, based on that input, displays messages back to the user.
        <br>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        You may do the work in the same HTML file that we used for our class demo today. Because the originals from class are saved in the class GitHub repo, there is no worry in overwriting them or need for saving an unnecessary extra copy.
        Using a total of four JavaScript ‘prompt’ statements along the lines of our class demo, have a user answer four questions.
        The user’s response to each question (input) should be stored in a separate variable. Name your variables carefully.
        Using these responses, return an alert to the user (output) that concatenates their response into some kind of reply like we did in class.
        Strive to have your alert for each question utilize the responses to all of the prior questions such that by the fourth question, your response would look something like, “Greetings, Iggy from Ipanema, I also like to eat bananas while on vacation in Paris.”
        Be creative and have fun with your questions/responses! They can be whatever you want so long as the input/output requirements are met.
        In addition, for each response, create a console.log() message that indicates the nature of the question and the user’s response, as we did in class.
        Set up the HTML document.
        <br>
         <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif ; background-color: cadetblue;">
             <h3>Goals</h3> 
            After completing all of the requirements listed above, you may optionally challenge yourself further by implementing some or all of the following into your application.
            
            Utilizing internal and inline styling as you wish, apply additional styling to the page: try things like borders, alignment, margin, padding, and so on.
            Search for an online HTML validator and submit your code to it. Take a screenshot of your output and submit the image.
            <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/accessibility/reference">Visit this page</a> and read about Chrome’s built-in accessibility auditing tools. Following the instructions under the “View the contrast ratio of a text element in the Color Picker” heading, examine the contrast ratio values of your heading and paragraph tags. Modify your code until you can achieve a ratio with that gets two check marks.
             Submit a screenshot of the Chrome tools showing this off.
